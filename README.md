# Simple neural network
Tried to build Neural network using python.

##Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/p69khggr1Jo) video by Siraj Raval on Youtube. This is a single layer feedforward neural network (perceptron). We use binary digits as our inputs and expect binary digits as our outputs. We'll use [backpropagation](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) via gradient descent to train our network and make our prediction as accurate as possible.

##Dependencies

numpy.

##Usage

Run ``python demo.py`` in terminal to see it train, then predict.
